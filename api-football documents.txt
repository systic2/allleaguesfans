Widgets
Our widgets are completely free and work with all our plans including the free plan.

To integrate the widgets to your site you just have to copy/paste the code provided and fill in the tags needed for the widget to work properly. If you integrate several widgets on the same page a single theme will be applied for all widgets. Also you will only have to integrate the script tag once.

For all widgets the following tags are needed :
data-host : v3.football.api-sports.io or api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com depending on whether you have subscribed with us or RapidApi.

data-key : Indicate your API-KEY obtained on our Dashboard or on RapidApi.

data-theme : If you leave the field empty, the default theme will be applied, otherwise the possible values are grey or dark. It is also possible to indicate false which will not display any theme and lets you customize the widget with your own css.

data-show-errors : By default false, used for debugging, with a value of true it allows to display the errors.

Widgets use the requests associated with your account and therefore they will stop working if your daily limit is reached. You can track all requests made directly in the dashboard.

Security :
When using these widgets it is important to be aware that your API-KEY will be visible to the users of your site, it is possible to protect yourself from this by allowing only the desired domains in our dashboard. This way no one else can use your API-KEY for you. If you have already set up your widget and have not activated this option, you can reset your API-KEY and activate this option after.

Debugging :
If the widget does not display the requested information, it is possible to set the data-show-errors tag to true to display error messages directly in the widget and in the console. This can be due to several things like : (Non-exhaustive list)

You have reached your daily number of requests
Tags are incorrectly filled in
Your API-KEY is incorrect

Examples available in Request samples "Use Cases".

All the parameters of this endpoint can be used together.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated each time a new league from a country not covered by the API is added.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per day.

query Parameters

string
The name of the country

code	
string [ 2 .. 6 ] characters FR, GB-ENG, IT…
The Alpha code of the country

search	
string = 3 characters

Leagues
Leagues
Get the list of available leagues and cups.

The league id are unique in the API and leagues keep it across all seasons

To get the logo of a competition you have to call the following url: https://media.api-sports.io/football/leagues/{league_id}.png

This endpoint also returns the coverage of each competition, which makes it possible to know what is available for that league or cup.

The values returned by the coverage indicate the data available at the moment you call the API, so for a competition that has not yet started, it is normal to have all the features set to False. This will be updated once the competition has started.

You can find all the leagues ids on our Dashboard.

Example :

"coverage": {
  "fixtures": {
      "events": true,
      "lineups": true,
      "statistics_fixtures": false,
      "statistics_players": false
  },
  "standings": true,
  "players": true,
  "top_scorers": true,
  "top_assists": true,
  "top_cards": true,
  "injuries": true,
  "predictions": true,
  "odds": false
}
In this example we can deduce that the competition does not have the following features: statistics_fixtures, statistics_players, odds because it is set to False.

The coverage of a competition can vary from season to season and values set to True do not guarantee 100% data availability.

Some competitions, such as the friendlies, are exceptions to the coverage indicated in the leagues endpoint, and the data available may differ depending on the match, including livescore, events, lineups, statistics and players.

Competitions are automatically renewed by the API when a new season is available. There may be a delay between the announcement of the official calendar and the availability of data in the API.

For Cup competitions, fixtures are automatically added when the two participating teams are known. For example if the current phase is the 8th final, the quarter final will be added once the teams playing this phase are known.

Examples available in Request samples "Use Cases".

Most of the parameters of this endpoint can be used together.

Fixtures are added between 15 and 5 minutes before the start of the fixture. Once the fixture is over they are removed from the endpoint between 5 and 20 minutes. No history is stored. So fixtures that are about to start, fixtures in progress and fixtures that have just ended are available in this endpoint.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 5 seconds.*
